### Hi there 👋 
I am a software developer lawyer, I live in Colombia and I am passionate about scraping in order to provide better information to people.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 Currently I don't work for any company, but I don't stop learning new things to continue programming.
- 🌱 I am currently studying web development and it is my second passion.
- 👯 I would like to collaborate on projects that involve learning new scraping techniques.
- 🤔 For people who want to learn a little more about the techniques that I know, do not hesitate to contact me on twitter
- 💬 Ask me about Python, C or Javascript.
